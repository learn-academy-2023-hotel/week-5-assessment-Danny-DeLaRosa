Researched answer:  An ORM is a programming technique used to convert data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages and relational databases. It allows developers to work with data as objects while the ORM system handles all the database interactions and conversions in the background.

4. STRETCH: What is the difference between inheritance in JavaScript and inheritance in Ruby?
